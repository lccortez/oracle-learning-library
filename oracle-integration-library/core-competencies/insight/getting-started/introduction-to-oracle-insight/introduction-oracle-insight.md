### About Oracle Integration Insight
Today's competitive market demands that stakeholders be able to understand, monitor, and react to changing market conditions. Businesses need flexible, dynamic, and detailed insight – and they need it as it happens.

Collecting, storing, visualizing, and reporting on business metrics in real time has traditionally been a costly undertaking, requiring significant investment of capital and engineering resources. Software is typically developed to meet the unique needs of business applications. In today’s sophisticated enterprise software environment, many businesses use multiple integrated systems, provided by a variety of vendors, further complicating the task of collecting business metrics.

The Integration Insight feature (commonly referred to as Insight) in Oracle Integration dramatically simplifies the process of modeling and extracting meaningful business metrics for business users. It provides built-in powerful business analytics through a business-friendly experience, allowing users to model, collect, and monitor metrics for their business processes to achieve real-time visibility and react quickly to changing demands.
